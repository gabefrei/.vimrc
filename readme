This is my customized .vimrc file for VIM. I tailored it for my own need.

It was inspired by many others' configurations files, and will be incrementally updated for the goal: simpler, faster, and powerful-er :)

As a believer of minimalism, I fully believe tha Vim is the perfect combination of simplicity, beauty and power.
